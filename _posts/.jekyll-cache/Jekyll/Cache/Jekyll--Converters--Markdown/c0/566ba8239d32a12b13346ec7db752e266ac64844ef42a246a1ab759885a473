I"·<p>Among my first memories is the larva squiggling its way along my eyelid, slipping into my tear duct, traveling upstream until It was happily lodged within my brain. As far as I am concerned, It has always been there. It has never caused me pain, for I am a good caretaker.</p>

<p>By day, I seek out the finest foods this barren plain has to offer. I scrabble with my ragged fingernails through the sand until I strike upon a twisted root. It is woody, but beneath the rough fibers that scrape my throat, there is a subtle sweetness. I savor every wrenching bite. Some may turn their noses at such a diet, but indeed, it is the toughness and the misery that gives the sugar such sublimity. And though I do not think of It, I know that It must enjoy it too, which pleases me. Tomorrow I shall check my traps; I hope that a mouse or a rabbit has fallen in. Such happenings are growing sparser these days, which means that the warm blood will be all the more pleasant on my tongue.</p>

<p>My conjecture is that They are to blame for the lack of wildlife. After one of Their great hordes swarms through the desert, it is often many weeks before my snares become fruitful once more. When I was a child, I would cower as They flew overhead, would cover my ears uselessly against the deafening buzz of their wings. Now, as I grow older, I no longer fear them; I stand eagerly when They darken the sky. The sight of Their pulsating abdomens causes my heart to rise to quivering euphoria, impaled between joy and fear. Oh, how I wish I could join them, don their impenetrable armors, rise on razor-sharp wings and ravage through the desolate cities! Alas, They leave before the sun sets, and I am left with nothing but the sand.</p>

<p>On those nights, I almost begin to hate Them. But then, good sense takes over, and I remember the gaping rib cages of my brothers, their screams of agony as their innards were torn asunder and devoured. What beneficence, what heavenly mercy, that I should be spared! They saw something special in me, some nobility deep within, that I should be imbued with It and given purpose in life.</p>

<p>Sometimes I speak to It as if it were a friend. On those nights when Its wriggling keeps me from sleep, I whisper my deepest desires to it. I tell It how I long for even more delectable foods: the sweet flesh of one like myself. My mouth waters at the thought of gripping those delicate vessels between my teeth. Other times, I am unable to speak to It, for I feel that we are one single being. Together, we blossom from my skull, fat and glistening. There is a twisted husk of a tree nearby, and we climb to its highest branches. We weave a cocoon around ourselves, wrapping so tightly that there is no room for anything but our love. When we emerge, there is nothing that can hold us back.</p>

<p>My sleep is increasingly dreamless, just an utter blackness punctuated by strange stars. When I do dream, what I find there terrifies me. It is not there in my dreams; there remains in Its place a void, not just an absence, but a sucking emptiness. And in that emptiness, there rises the terrible knowledge that I shall never take to the skies, that I shall die paralyzed, face down in the despicable sand. In that delirium, I am seized by the idea that I must refuse all food, I must let my body waste away in the heat, until, staring into the sun, I feel It cease Itâ€™s wriggling, and my last breaths escape me.</p>

<p>Then I awaken and feel the gnawing of my stomach. I eat.</p>
